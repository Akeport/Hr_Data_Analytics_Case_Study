## Project Description

Employee turnover is a significant issue for many organizations — it affects recruitment and training costs, as well as the loss of organizational knowledge.  
In this project, HR data was analyzed to:

- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition  
- Build a predictive model estimating the probability of an employee leaving  
- Provide insights and recommendations for the HR department

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – modeling and evaluation

## Analysis Stages

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analysis of demographic and job-related variables  
   - Checking for missing data and outliers  
   - Visualization of correlations between variables  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Standardizing numerical data  
   - Splitting data into training and test sets  

3. **Predictive Model Building**  
   - Comparison of several models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

4. **Conclusions and Recommendations**  
   - Identification of key factors influencing employee attrition

## Results

- The greatest impact on attrition risk was found in: job satisfaction, tenure, performance rating, and salary.
